## ABOUT

This is a small jQuery plugin that adds support for placeholder text to browsers that don't currently support placeholder text.

It uses the placeholder attribute if specified, and should act just as natively support placeholder text does.

Additionally, you can style the inputs with a placeholder applied using the .placeholder class in your style sheet.
